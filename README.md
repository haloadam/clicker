# Clicker program for detecting point scores
# requirements: NodeJS and Python
# https://nodejs.org/en/download/
# https://www.python.org/downloads/
# use npm install to install all needed packages, run the program with "node index"
# Currently, the only supported site is "sports.williamhill.com" and the supported sport is tennis
# When running the program, the program will prompt up a message saying
# "Enter match ID and check top"
# The first input should be a tennis match's ID from the URL and the second property is whether the program should scan for the top point or the bottom point
# If you want to check for the top point, input "true", otherwise input "false"
# The program will detect whether the point has changed and will emit a click event if it did in fact change.
